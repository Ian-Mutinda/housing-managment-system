Overview
The Housing Management System is a small-scale application designed to help streamline rental property operations for both tenants and landlords. Built using Python (Flask) for the backend and JavaScript/HTML/CSS for the frontend, this system allows users to register, log in, view/manage property details, track payments, communicate with landlords, and more.
This project is designed for educational purposes and can be scaled up for real-world deployment with further enhancements.
